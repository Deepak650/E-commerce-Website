# E-commerce Website - Static Site

This is a simple static e-commerce website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is containerized using Docker and can be easily deployed on any platform using Kubernetes.

## Features

- **Product Listings**: Displays products dynamically with JavaScript.
- **Cart**: Allows users to view and manage their shopping cart (front-end only).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
- **Dockerized**: The project is packaged in a Docker container.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: The website can be deployed on Kubernetes for easy scaling and management.
- **Multi-page Navigation**: Includes pages for Home, Products, Cart, Checkout, Contact, Login, Register, and About.

## Technologies

- **HTML5**: Used for the structure and content of the pages.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic functionality such as managing products and cart.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the web app for easy deployment.
- **Nginx**: Web server to serve the static files in Docker.
- **Kubernetes**: For managing containerized applications at scale.
- **Optional**: Ingress controllers for routing traffic in Kubernetes.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepak650/E-commerce-Website.git
   cd ecommerce-website

2. Install Dependencies (If needed): For a basic static site, no additional dependencies are required. If you have a build process (like using Webpack, etc.), install them using:

bash
Copy code
npm install

Docker Setup
1. Build the Docker image: In the root directory of the project, run the following command to build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t ecommerce-website .

2.Run the Docker container: Once the image is built, run the container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 80:80 ecommerce-website

3. Access the Website: Open a browser and go to http://localhost to view the website running in the Docker container.

4. Optional: Docker Compose: If you want to use docker-compose for easier management (if you have multiple services), you can create a docker-compose.yml file. Here's an example:

yaml
Copy code
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: ecommerce-website
    ports:
      - "80:80"
Then, run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build

**Kubernetes Deployment**
1. Create a Kubernetes Deployment: This project can be deployed on Kubernetes. The deployment is defined in the ecommerce-deployment.yaml file. Apply the Kubernetes configuration with the following command:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f ecommerce-deployment.yaml

2. Check the Deployment: To verify the status of the deployed application:

bash
Copy code
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc

3. Access the Service: If you're using a cloud provider (like AWS, GCP, or Azure), you can access the website via a LoadBalancer IP. If you're using a local Kubernetes setup (like Minikube), you can access the website through the NodePort or using port forwarding.

Example:

bash
Copy code
kubectl port-forward svc/ecommerce-service 8080:80
This will expose the website on http://localhost:8080.
